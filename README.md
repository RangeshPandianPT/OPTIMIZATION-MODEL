This project demonstrates how to solve a product mix optimization problem for a furniture manufacturing company using Python and the PuLP library.

## Features

- Maximizes profit based on machine and labor constraints
- Solves using Linear Programming (LP)
- Generates visualization and CSV exports
- Includes slack analysis for unused resources

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

The company manufactures three products: **Chairs**, **Tables**, and **Desks**. Each product uses time on:

- 🏭 Machine A
- ⚙️ Machine B
- 👷 Labor

---

## 📈 Features

- 📊 Linear Programming model using **PuLP**
- 🛠️ Resource constraints for realistic planning
- 🔍 Slack analysis for unused resources
- 📑 CSV reports of production and resource usage
- 📸 Bar chart preview of the production plan
- 📁 Easy-to-run Jupyter Notebook

## 🗂️ Files Included

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `optimization_project.ipynb` | Jupyter notebook with code, LP model, and analysis |
| `production_summary.csv`     | Units produced, profit per product, total profit |
| `slack_report.csv`           | Unused machine/labor hours (slack variables) |
| `production_plan.png`        | Visualization of the optimal production mix |
| `README.md`                  | Documentation and usage instructions |
